# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This program takes a 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise.

## Function
The main function in this program is `rotate_2d_matrix`, which takes a 2D square matrix as input and rotates it in-place.

## Usage
To run the program, simply call the `rotate_2d_matrix` function with a 2D list representing the matrix you want to rotate. The matrix will be rotated in-place, and the rotated matrix will be returned.

## Example
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
          
rotated_matrix = rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
print(rotated_matrix)
```
