# 0x05. N Queens

## Overview
This project focuses on solving the N Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard in a way that no two queens attack each other. The project includes an algorithmic approach to find solutions for different values of N in an efficient manner.

## Installation
To run the project, download the source code files onto your local machine. Make sure you have a Python environment set up to execute the code. No external dependencies need to be installed.

## Usage
Run the `n_queens.py` script with the desired value of N as an input parameter. The script will output the possible solutions for placing N queens on an NxN chessboard without attacking each other.

Example usage:
```
python n_queens.py 4
```

## Algorithm
The project uses a backtracking algorithm to find solutions for the N Queens problem. The algorithm recursively places queens on the chessboard and checks for conflicts with existing queens. If a conflict is found, it backtracks and tries a different position until a valid solution is found.

## Performance
The algorithm's time complexity is O(N!), where N is the size of the chessboard. The efficiency of the algorithm decreases exponentially as N increases, but it can still find solutions for moderate values of N in a reasonable amount of time.
